Introduction
This project demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects" to design software.
 It allows for better organization, reusability, and maintainability of code by bundling related data and functions together in classes.

Key Concepts
1. Classes and Objects
Classes: Act as blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data.
Objects: Instances of classes. Each object can have different values for the data defined in the class.
2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components,
 which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse.
4. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.
5. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. It can be achieved through function overloading,
 operator overloading, and overriding.
7. Abstraction
Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.
Usage
This project is a conceptual guide, including examples that showcase how OOP principles are applied in C++.
 It is intended for educational purposes, helping users understand how to structure C++ programs using OOP concepts.
